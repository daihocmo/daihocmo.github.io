Very Easy \u3054\u6ce8\u6587\u306f\u3046\u3055\u304e\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f Nothing much to say here, very simple slice of life. Even if you don't understand a particular dialogue you can still get healed by the cuteness. Very Easy \u3057\u308d\u304f\u307e\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7 It's very easy because all the dialogues are slow, use only basic grammar, and the topics are almost all about slice-of-life content. It revolves around two stories each episode, so the predictability of the narrative is very short with the beginning, middle, and end of a narrative in less than 15 minutes each. Very Easy \u602a\u8ac7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3 Each episode is a collection of three or two short, simple ghost stories. Vocabulary is mostly basic, predominantly slice of life or schoold related. The only more challenging bit is the intro to episodes where each of the stories is briefly introduced as if it were a restaurant dish using some keigo. Easy \u3051\u3044\u304a\u3093! Easy cute girls doing cute things anime, some music vocabulary but not much. Good vibes, even if you don't get anything you'll still feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Easy \u3053\u307f\u3063\u304f\u304c\u30fc\u308b\u305a Cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT) with easy to understand language. Easy \u3086\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u25b3 Dialogue is easy, the important parts are the atmosphere, mood and visuals. Easy \u306e\u3093\u306e\u3093\u3073\u3088\u308a Easy dialogue, the pace is great and the characters don't speak too fast either. Easy \u8072\u306e\u5f62 Made it easier from the fact that they sometimes use their hands to communicate. It's a film so it's not too long either which helps. Easy \u3086\u308b\u3086\u308a Very easy SoL vocabulary, recommended for a beginner. Easy \u304b\u3089\u304b\u3044\u4e0a\u624b\u306e\u9ad8\u6728\u3055\u3093 It uses simple expressions, easy grammar and both protagonists speak slowly so you can grasp the meaning of words very easily. Easy \u5973\u795e\u306e\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u30c6\u30e9\u30b9 It's easy because all of the dialogues are simple, most of the words are very common, and the grammar is very basic. It's not very easy because sometimes the dialogue between the girls and the guy can overlap, becoming a fast-paced dialogue. I would definitely recommend it for beginners, but the speed of the dialogue is certainly higher than, say, Takagi San. Easy \u305f\u307e\u3053\u307e\u30fc\u3051\u3063\u3068 Simple slice of life/CGDCT vocabulary, nothing too hard going on here. Easy \u3042\u306e\u65e5\u898b\u305f\u82b1\u306e\u540d\u524d\u3092\u50d5\u9054\u306f\u307e\u3060\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002 Simple slice of life, no specific terminology, half of the show is kids speaking so it's easier to understand, hardest part is not crying at the end. Easy planetarian \uff5e\u3061\u3044\u3055\u306a\u307b\u3057\u306e\u3086\u3081\uff5e Easy anime movie, nothing much to say outside of the fact that the robot speaks in a little convoluted way using \u656c\u8a9e. Easy planetarian\uff5e\u661f\u306e\u4eba\uff5e See above. Easy \u5b87\u5b99\u3088\u308a\u3082\u9060\u3044\u5834\u6240 Outside of some characters speaking a bit fast from time to time, this is mostly easy. Easy \u307c\u304f\u305f\u3061\u306f\u52c9\u5f37\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044 Very simple harem SoL stuff, nothing hard here. Easy \u50d5\u306f\u53cb\u9054\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u3044 Once again a standard slice of life romcom harem anime. Nothing too spectacular to note here, all the characters speak pretty clearly and the subject matter isn't hard either. Easy \u5e72\u7269\u59b9\uff01\u3046\u307e\u308b\u3061\u3083\u3093 Standard slice of life fare, Umaru can speak a bit fast in certain parts and her friend has an accent from time to time. Other than this, nothing much to worry about. Easy \u963f\u6ce2\u9023\u3055\u3093\u306f\u306f\u304b\u308c\u306a\u3044 There is nothing too difficult to see here, it's mostly slice of life vocabulary with some occasional tangents by the main character when he's in delusion-mode looking at Aharen-san. Easy \u30c8\u30cb\u30ab\u30af\u30ab\u30ef\u30a4\u30a4 Very rarely some business terms are used but it's mostly simple romcom vocabulary and sentence structure. Easy Kanon Pretty simple, it's a standard dating sim adaptation. The plot becomes important in the latter part of the anime so it's slightly more difficult than general slice of life anime, but it's still easy. Easy \u304a\u5144\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3060\u3051\u3069\u611b\u3055\u3048\u3042\u308c\u3070\u95a2\u4fc2\u306a\u3044\u3088\u306d\u3063 Simple harem romcom, the dialogue isn't too hard and the vocabulary is simple. Easy WORKING!! Slice of life full of comedy so the vocabulary and grammar aren't too hard. There's very little plot until later on which means you can just enjoy the comedy without caring too much at first. Easy \u307e\u3058\u3082\u3058\u308b\u308b\u3082 Pretty easy slice of life anime with a slight fantasy twist. The dialogues are easy and the plot isn't too important outside of the last few episodes. Easy \u30d0\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u3002 Some manga terminology, the rest is pretty easy since it is a slice of life mostly. Easy Buddy Daddies Mostly slice of life vocab and dialogue I don't remember anything that was too difficult. Easy \u53ef\u611b\u3044\u3060\u3051\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u5f0f\u5b88\u3055\u3093 Slice of life vocabulary, nothing too hard to see here. Easy \u6708\u304c\u304d\u308c\u3044 Simple romance story with no real twists so very easy to follow. Characters use simple daily life language. Easy \u30b3\u30bf\u30ed\u30fc\u306f\u4e00\u4eba\u66ae\u3089\u3057 Slice of life without too much complicated vocab, though the main character kotarou speaks weird might be a bit hard to get used to but it's not too bad. Easy \u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u30ba\uff01 A lot of gamer slang is used, but the rest is fine. Easy \u5f7c\u5973\u3001\u304a\u501f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059 The usual romance vocabulary, nothing much to say here. Easy-Medium \u30d2\u30ca\u307e\u3064\u308a Extremely funny with simple dialogues. The only difficulty is the slight yakuza slang from time to time. Other than that, decent especially since Hina speaks slowly in a calm voice. Easy-Medium \u56db\u6708\u306f\u541b\u306e\u5618 A lot of music words but other than that the conversations are pretty easy. Easy-Medium \u306f\u3058\u3081\u306e\u4e00\u6b69 THE FIGHTING! Main difficulty comes from the boxing terms but they are explained accordingly, so it's still decently easy. Easy-Medium \u65e5\u5e38 Overall not too hard, although some references can be hard to catch. Even if you don't understand anything you can usually get what's going on from the visuals. You can watch this without understanding anything and still have a good time. Easy-Medium BNA \u30d3\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30cc\u30fb\u30a8\u30fc It has some sci-fi/scientific explainations but other than that it is pretty pretty simple. Easy-Medium \u3068\u3089\u30c9\u30e9\uff01 Mostly SoL/romance vocabulary. Nothing too hard to follow, though there is an underlying plot. Easy-Medium \u3060\u304c\u3057\u304b\u3057 A few dagashi words but nothing too hard. Easy-Medium \u4e2d\u4e8c\u75c5\u3067\u3082\u604b\u304c\u3057\u305f\u3044! The only hard parts are when the characters go into chuunibyou mode. The rest of the dialogue is standard slice of life romcom stuff, so nothing too hard. If you want to understand everything, it's closer to medium. Easy-Medium \u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973\u307e\u3069\u304b\u2605\u30de\u30ae\u30ab Deconstruction of the magical girl genre which means you get some fantasy vocabulary but nothing much, mostly mahou shoujo/witch stuff. It's not too hard but the plot is important so if you miss stuff you'll be confused. Easy-Medium \u5742\u9053\u306e\u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u30f3 The vocabulary and sentence structures aren't very hard, although there is obviously some jazz terminology thrown in there. Easy-Medium \u6589\u6728\u6960\u96c4\u306e\u03a8\u96e3 The characters can talk a bit fast but other than this should be fine. Easy-Medium \u92fc\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST Has some military vocabulary here and there but overall it's fairly easy from a language perspective with fairly standard vocabulary and grammar otherwise. Easy-Medium \u307c\u3063\u3061\u30fb\u3056\u30fb\u308d\u3063\u304f\uff01 Mostly slice of life conversations, however there is some music terminology that are used and many jokes, some of which may be hard to understand. Easy-Medium \u9752\u6625\u30d6\u30bf\u91ce\u90ce\u306f\u30d0\u30cb\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u5148\u8f29\u306e\u5922\u3092\u898b\u306a\u3044 The usual SoL vocabulary but with the addition of occasional quantum mechanics terms and concepts. Easy-Medium \u7121\u8077\u8ee2\u751f Nothing too difficult, standard fantasy setting with standard fantasy vocabulary. Easy-Medium Bartender The anime is episodical so even if you don't understand one episode, the next one is mostly not affected. Some cocktail terminology you need to pick up but the leisurely pace and mood make it easier. Easy-Medium \u30b9\u30e9\u30e0\u30c0\u30f3\u30af The main difficulty comes from the various basketball terms, but they are usually explained when they're introduced which makes it easier. Medium \u30ce\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30fb\u30ce\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5 Involves psychological battles where the ability to follow along is pivotal to the enjoyment. Some characters can also speak fairly quickly sometimes. That being said, there isn't too much to say specifically about the vocabulary and grammar being used as it's fairly standard. Medium \u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc The difficulty varies from episode to episode, with some of them having a lot more medical jargon and philosophical terms. Medium \u30d7\u30ed\u30e1\u30a2 Sci-fi action anime film, has some challenging bits but overall is fairly normal. Medium \u7570\u4e16\u754c\u85ac\u5c40 The story is as straightforward as it gets with an isekai but be prepared not only for intermittent keigo and fantasy vocabulary befitting the setting but also (and most importantly) quite a lot of words related to (real-world) medicine, health conditions, illnesses, etc. Medium \u3066\u30fc\u304d\u3085\u3046 Slice of life shitpost anime, episodes are super short so easy to digest. Medium \u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30b5\u30ac Harder than basic romcoms and the likes, but not too difficult either. Has some fantasy/historical vocabulary. Medium Serial Experiments Lain While the anime itself is hard to understand with a lot of symbolism, the actual speech isn't too hard for a good part of the anime. Some of the latter scenes can be a bit harder to understand, but the language used isn't too difficult. Medium \u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u00d7\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc The arcs themselves can vary a lot in difficulty, from easy-medium to medium-hard so medium seems decent as a difficulty marker. There's shonen lingo as well as general fantasy vocabulary. Medium \u30c7\u30b9\u30fb\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9 The main character uses keigo and the subject matter is more complex than basic slice of life or romcom anime, but it is still not extremely difficult. While the plot is important, the various games are interesting on their own. Medium \u30d4\u30f3\u30dd\u30f3 THE ANIMATION While the vocabulary isn't too complicated, some characters speak in Chinese with Japanese subtitles and the dialogues can get a bit philosophical at times. Obviously there's some ping pong terminology, although ping pong isn't actually the main theme of this anime. Medium \u5730\u7344\u5b66\u5712 One character speaks like a samurai, there is some wordplay and the characters can talk a bit fast at times. Overall not too hard, but not quite very easy either. Still, the comedy is so good that even if you don't fully understand what's going on you might like it nonetheless. Medium \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30af Some characters have their own speaking style where add things to the ends of their sentences or use slightly rarer words so it can be a touch harder to pick up on what they say. Medium \u95d8\u724c\u4f1d\u8aac\u30a2\u30ab\u30ae\u3000\u95c7\u306b\u821e\u3044\u964d\u308a\u305f\u5929\u624d Knowing Mahjong is an absolute requirement for this one or you will be completely lost. Other than this, medium difficulty. Medium-Hard \u9006\u5883\u7121\u983c\u30ab\u30a4\u30b8 Ultimate Survivor Just like above (it's the same author), this centers on mahjong with a strong focus on psychology. It is slightly more difficult though, because you need to pretty accurately understand the rules of each gamble in order to fully enjoy it and there is fairly uncommon vocabulary used by the narrator in Kaiji's particular style of writing. Medium-Hard \u7d04\u675f\u306e\u30cd\u30d0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 The grammar is very complicated sometimes, and the vocabulary is not that easy. However, the narrative is clear as water, and the dialogues are very well written. It seems like you're reading a novel only made with dialogues. With Violet, even if the vocabulary is sometimes abstract (because of the story), you can almost always keep understanding because of the clearly written dialogue. Medium-Hard \u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 The anime varies in difficult, in some episodes it is rather easy, towards the end it becomes pretty difficult with intricate dialogue discussing somewhat deep ideas. The mecha and technological terms can be a bit hard at first as well.   The rebuilds (movies for Evangelion) are roughly of the same difficulty. Medium-Hard \u30f1\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30f2\u30f3\u65b0\u5287\u5834\u7248:\u5e8f See above. Medium-Hard \u9b54\u6cd5\u79d1\u9ad8\u6821\u306e\u52a3\u7b49\u751f Miyuki speaks in very polite speech, lots of technical words, the magic system is very complete but also technological in nature and thus sometimes a bit hard to follow. Hard \u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\u7d76\u671b\u5148\u751f Constant cultural references, tricky Japanese from time to time with a weird cast makes this one harder than your average anime. Very Hard \u7bc4\u99ac\u5203\u7259 SON OF OGRE The anime is full of phraseology, long dialogues that use words or vocabulary that are not commonly used. In addition, everything is pronounced quite quickly and if you do not hear it, you can miss the whole essence of the dialog or monologue. Very Hard \u5200\u8a9e Edo- era vocabulary, complicated samurai imagery with episodes that are unusually long for anime. The plot is not exactly episodical but each episode usually focuses on a different sword with a lot of historical and samurai terms. Interesting and witty dialogue that tends to go on and on making it difficult to follow. Very Hard \u56db\u7573\u534a\u795e\u8a71\u5927\u7cfb Extremely fast-paced dialogues, constant references to literary works, obscure cultural references and philosophical considerations all dumped into one big pot. It's already difficult in English, so good luck in Japanese. Really good though. Very Hard \u5e73\u5bb6\u7269\u8a9e Set in 12th century Japan and follows the Taira clan and Minamoto clan. All characters use old Japanese and archaic terms making it extremely hard to follow along without subtitles, and requires lots of experience and possibly some historical knowledge to be able to follow along with subtitles if you dont want to do a lot of lookups.

These are all good! There are also some great contemporary non-period films too. Wanted to craft a list of favorites from 1985 onward\u2014good for shadowing, and simply great for watching and rewatching. These all left a powerful impact after viewing.</p> <ul> <li>Tampopo (\u305f\u3093\u307d\u307d, 1985) A mix of unique narratives, mainly a trucker helps a Ramenya owner spiff up her Ramen.</li> <li>The Eel (\u3046\u306a\u304e, 1997) A man rebuilds his life after prison, along with his pet eel.</li> <li>After Life (\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30d5\u30eb\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5, 1998) I recommend this the most! A group of recently-deceased people must choose their most important memory, film it, then enter that moment for eternity.</li> <li>Kikujiro (\u83ca\u6b21\u90ce\u306e\u590f, 1999) A gambler helps a young boy find his long lost mother. Kitano\u2019s in it and beautiful Hisaishi music. Both funny and touching.</li> <li>Battle Royal (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30ed\u30ef\u30a4\u30a2\u30eb, 2000) A school class fights each other to the death on an island. Popular for good reason. Watch before you watch the hunger games.</li> <li>Eureka (\u30e6\u30ea\u30a4\u30ab, 2000) Three survivors process their lives after a bus shooting. Four hours long, but feels like a trip if you get through it.</li> <li>Taste of Tea (\u8336\u306e\u5473, 2004) A family in rural Japan. The brother learns go to confront his crush, the sister is watched by a giant version of herself, the mother works on her anime sequence, the uncle drifts around and records music. Love this movie. So worth watching to the end.</li> <li>Survive Style 5+ (\u30b5\u30d0\u30a4\u30f4\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb5\uff0b, 2004) Three friends, a man whose wife keep returning from the dead, an American hitman, and a family whose father thinks he\u2019s a chicken, and a commercial writer\u2026 Be prepared.

Perverted, but feels epic somehow and admirable for its sheer unorthodoxy.</li> <li>Kaiji (\u30ab\u30a4\u30b8 \u4eba\u751f\u9006\u8ee2\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0, 2009) Ok, based off a manga I think, but liked it. About the misadventures and mind games of a gambler trying to get out of debt.</li> <li>I wish (\u5947\u8de1, 2011) Two brothers living in separate cities plan to run off and meet in Kumamoto where the shinkansen trains cross in order to make a wish for their families to reunite.</li> <li>Himizu (\u30d2\u30df\u30ba, 2011) Watch for some beautiful, poetic, violent teen angst.</li> <li>Kirishima Thing (\u6850\u5cf6\u3001\u90e8\u6d3b\u3084\u3081\u308b\u3063\u3066\u3088, 2012) The top athlete drops out of school, and nobody knows why.

Sad, but a good movie.</li> <li>Adrift in Tokyo (\u8ee2\u3005, 2007) A whimsical gem: A thug offers to pay a law student\u2019s gambling debt if he accompanies him on a trip across Tokyo.</li> <li>I just didn\u2019t do it (\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u30dc\u30af\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044, 2007) A guy\u2019s life goes off the rails when he's falsely accused of molesting a woman on the train.

Witty writing, fun for learners.</li> <li>Flowers in the shadows (\u9670\u65e5\u5411\u306b\u54b2\u304f, 2008) for interweaving, melodramatic, but genuinely engaging plot threads. Coincidences, twists and redemption stories.</li> <li>100 Yen Love (\u767e\u5186\u306e\u604b, 20014) A woman moves out to live on her own, working in a convenience store, then after meeting a boxer decides to take up boxing.

A slice of life of four women in their thirties who are friends.

A funny, touching, fascinating film.</li> </ul> <p>You can also search what won the Japan Academy Prize of the year. Please watch these\u2014those I've seen are great and I didn\u2019t do them justice. Thanks all for your good finds and descriptions.</p> <p>What would you add to the list?</p> <p>Ringu, The Grudge, Pulse, Dark Water, Suicide Club, Cure, Battle Royale.</p> <p>Yeah, I second that recommendation. Japanese horror movies are fairly easy to follow.</p> <p>Also consider reading the novels that those movies were based on. When I started to read Japanese novels, I found horror novels easier to read compared to other genres since it's mostly slice-of-life-based. The Ring trilogy was one of the first adult novels I read in Japanese. Battle Royale is really fun too (it's in print only so you'll have to buy a physical version of the novel).</p> <p>For more j-horror, I highly recommend is One Cut of the Dead (\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u3092\u6b62\u3081\u308b\u306a\uff01) which is a zombie film. That is one of recent favorites. Even thought I was getting jaded by zombie movies, but this is really creative take on the genre. A horror-comedy movie about a director trying to make a zombie movie all in one cut with no edits.</p> <p>There are some huge twists so try to avoid reading reviews and watch it blind. I will say that even if you do not like it, watch it till at least the halfway point.</p> <p>Godzilla Minus One (\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9-1.0) is more kaiju than pure horror but Godzilla is absolutely terrifying in this film. It is a seriously good movie, that also covers post-war Japan and I was not expecting to get so emotional while watching it. I will say that some of the dialogue may be hard for you to parse when they go into battle plans of defeating Godzilla, but there's a lot of slice-of-life dialogue as it follows a young man trying to rebuild his life in post-war Tokyo. Regardless, I highly recommend this film as it might be my movie of the year.</p> <p>For slice-of-life, someone mentioned Hirokazu Koreeda and that's a great suggestion too because the acting is more natural so the dialogue will test your hearing a lot more than other films, because characters aren't just to say every word with perfected diction. He also often uses first time actors.</p> <p>He's inspired by the great Yasijiru Ozu, considered to be one of Japanese best filmmakers along with Akira Kurosara. Ozu pioneered this slow more naturalist way of making movies, and its very Japanese in the way the scenes are shot and edited, often using low camera angles.</p> <p>Tokyo Story is his most famous film but I recommend checking out the entire \"Noriko trilogy\" as in some ways I like the earlier movies more but they all pack a big emotional punch (his film at first seem to be about nothing, but it very slowly ramps up the emotional intensity).</p> <ul> <li>Late Spring (\u6669\u6625, Banshun)</li> <li>Early Summer (\u9ea5\u79cb, Bakush\u016b)</li> <li>Tokyo Story (\u6771\u4eac\u7269\u8a9e, T\u014dky\u014d Monogatari)</li> </ul> <p>If you want a more modern director / film. one recent film that was really cool from a learner's perspective was The Great Passage (\u821f\u3092\u7de8\u3080 Fune Wo Amu). It won many awards in Japan. It's charming movie about a small team of people trying to make a new Japanese dictionary. Yeah, the plot might sound boring, but it's a really charming film. Since the characters all love the Japanese language, I learned a lot of interesting words, especially dictionary-related words.</p> <p>It's based on the book, also called \u821f\u3092\u7de8\u3080, and it's just been made into a spin-off TV show, that is now airing in Japan.</p> <p>Other suggestions:</p> <p>Juzo Itami films:</p> <ul> <li>Tampopo (\u30bf\u30f3\u30dd\u30dd)</li> <li>A Taxing Woman (\u30de\u30eb\u30b5\u306e\u5973)</li> <li>The Funeral (\u304a\u846c\u5f0f)</li> </ul> <p>They are all slice-of-life and he was one of Japanese most creative directors, often mixing genres together. Tampopo is his most famous film, a wild and funny food adventure that will make you hungry, but I recommend checking out his other films as well.</p> <p>There are a ton of fantastic j-horror films out there, but for a beginner language learner, I think shorter media might be more helpful. In particular, I'm thinking of the \"Tales of Terror from Tokyo\" (\u602a\u8ac7\u65b0\u8033\u888b, Maidan Shin Mimibukuro) series. Technically, each story is about five minutes, but there's a lot of them. They'll be the same length as a full length film if you binge them all. Each story is self-contained and to the point, but there's plenty of useful vocabulary you can use in real life.</p> <p>There's also \"13 Real Asian Horror Stories,\" also known as \"13 Japanese Horror Stories Based on Real Life Events.\"</p> <p>You could also look into the Yami Shibai (\u95c7\u829d\u5c45) anime series. These stories are also 5 minutes, 13 episodes per season at 9 seasons.</p> <p>Sticking with anime, I hear \"Hell Teacher N\u016bb\u0113\" (\u5730\u7344\u5148\u751f\u306c\u301c\u3079\u301c, Jigoku Sensei N\u016bb\u0113) and Ghost Stories (\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u602a\u8ac7, Gakk\u014d no Kaidan) are good for full-length 30-minute episodes.</p> <p>\"Mieruko-chan\" (\u898b\u3048\u308b\u5b50\u3061\u3083\u3093) is also quite good.</p> <p>When you're more advanced, you might also want to watch the movie Kwaidan. It's a group of four samurai-age horror stories. Altogether, it's about three hours.</p> <p>Oh, and this last one is more of a thriller than a horror, but the film \"Confessions\" (\u544a\u767d, Kokuhaku) is absolutely amazing. The implications legitimately kept me up worse than any modern j-horror.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/","title":"Podcasts","text":"<p>M\u00ecnh l\u1ea5y Podcast t\u1eeb \u0111\u00e2y.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/#podcast-danh-cho-nguoi-hoc","title":"Podcast d\u00e0nh cho ng\u01b0\u1eddi h\u1ecdc","text":"T\u00ean Podcast N\u1ed9i dung tr\u00ean Podcast d\u01b0\u1edbi d\u1ea1ng vi\u1ebft Nihongo con Teppei (beginner) Sakura Tips https://sakuratips.com/category/pod-cast/ Japanese with Shun https://www.patreon.com/Japanesewithshun Nihongo for You https://www.nihongoforyou.com/episodes/ Momoko To Nihongo https://www.momoko-to-nihongo.com/podcast-scripts Let's Learn Japanese with Movies https://www.letslearnjapanesewithmovies.com/node/131 \u55ab\u8336\u30cb\u30db\u30f3\u30b4 for Japanese learners https://kissa.nihongo.japaneselesson-shiga.com/episodesandscripts/ The Miku Real Japanese Podcast https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP6jQzrtQ71_R7lSyJLe95Qu60Xos-FeH Nihongo Switch https://nihongoswitch.com/podcast-transcripts The Real Japanese Podcast https://www.haru-no-nihongo.com/podcast \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u8074\u89e3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306ePodcast http://akanesenseijp.com/category/%e3%83%96%e3%83%ad%e3%82%b0/ Learn Japanese with Noriko https://www.japanesewithnoriko.com/season-1-transcription YUYU\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9ePodcast https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8dWfySP_cKDMFj6aFfQbFA/videos Let\u2019s Talk in Japanese https://ruby-s.net/script/ Hapa\u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71 Podcast https://hapaeikaiwa.com/blog/category/podcast/ Kevinvin sleepy Japanese Nihongo con Teppei Original Archives 1-700 Learn Japanese from real talks N\u3042\uff5e casual nihongo \u304d\u307e\u3050\u308c\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e Casual Japanese 4989 American Life https://www.4989americanlife.com/blog Sayuri Saying https://www.youtube.com/c/SayuriSaying"},{"location":"resources/","title":"T\u00e0i nguy\u00ean","text":"<p>\u0110\u00e2y l\u00e0 trang t\u00e0i nguy\u00ean c\u1ee7a TheMoeWay, xem trang g\u1ed1c v\u00e0 \u0111\u1ea7y \u0111\u1ee7 h\u01a1n t\u1ea1i \u0111\u00e2y.

The descriptions aren't overly complicated which makes it easier for beginners. Very Easy \u5a18\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u3066\u79c1\u3008\u30de\u30de\u3009\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u306e!? Nothing complicated going on, simple vocabulary with simple grammar. Recommended for beginners. Every volume has a short summary of the story so far, making it even easier. It does not get harder as the series goes on. Very Easy \u307e\u305f\u3001\u540c\u3058\u5922\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3044\u305f Very easy vocabulary, it's mostly a monologue from a primary school student.

A lot of the book is a conversation to a child or about one. Very Easy-Easy \u305c\u3093\u3076\u3001\u85cd\u8272\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002 Half the length of most LNs, with very limited romance (and painting) focused vocabulary and overall short sentences. But the story is not entirely chronological and there are some twists to it, hence the bump up from the easiest difficulty. Easy \u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb\u4eba\u9593 Award- winning book about a \u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb employee, so features a lot of \u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb related vocabulary which is mostly easy. Decently short too, around 60k characters. Easy \u4e16\u754c\u304b\u3089\u732b\u304c\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u306a\u3089 Pretty clear plot structure with decently easy grammar and vocabulary make it easy to follow. Easy \u661f\u306e\u5b50 Simple writing style with mostly common words. The story is told from a child's point of view, there is some vocabulary about diseases. Easy \u5929\u56fd\u306b\u6d99\u306f\u3044\u3089\u306a\u3044 Very simple and straightforward, it has some christian vocab but basically everything has furigana. Easy \u7720\u308c\u306a\u3044\u591c\u306f\u7f8a\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3066 The limited length of each story forces the author to get to the point fast. Vocabulary is pretty much pure slice of life but sometimes it does dip briefly into topics that aren't explored in your typical beginner light novel. Easy \u50d5\u306f\u50d5\u306e\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u5c0f\u8aac\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 Most sentences are not long, no difficult vocab, pleasant writing style. Easy \u306b\u305b\u3082\u306e\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9 Vocabulary is limited to basic school and romance stuff so very easy but the story is told via alternating perspectives of the two MCs and there are some light deception shenanigans going on, so you have to pay a bit of attention not to get lost as to where the characters stand, metaphorically speaking. But overall an easy read. Easy \u30e9\u30d6\u30b3\u30e1\u6f2b\u753b\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u63a8\u3057\u306e\u8ca0\u3051\u30d2\u30ed\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u5168\u529b\u3067\u5e78\u305b\u306b\u3059\u308b A good starter light novel. Very simple vocabulary and writing.

Easy \u3042\u3072\u308b Slice of life setting with simple grammar and common words. Consists of three loosely related short stories. Easy \u96a3\u306e\u5e2d\u306e\u4f50\u85e4\u3055\u3093 Easy and pleasant to read, no hard vocab, chill slice of life romance consisting of two volumes.

Easy \u4f59\u547d\u4e00\u5e74\u3068\u5ba3\u544a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u50d5\u304c\u3001\u4f59\u547d\u534a\u5e74\u306e\u541b\u3068\u51fa\u4f1a\u3063\u305f\u8a71 Decently easy light novel, the vocabulary is easy even though the setting is heavy. Easy-Medium \u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3067\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u653e\u6d6a\u30e1\u30b7 If you don\u2019t know anything about Japanese cooking, or cooking in general, it\u2019s going to be slightly more difficult. Other than that it uses mostly simple language except for some very few characters. Easy-Medium \u304a\u96a3\u306e\u5929\u4f7f\u69d8\u306b\u3044\u3064\u306e\u9593\u306b\u304b\u99c4\u76ee\u4eba\u9593\u306b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u4ef6 The writing isn't very difficult outside of maybe some keigo expressions from the female MC. Easy-Medium \u5acc\u308f\u308c\u308b\u52c7\u6c17 Some words are not the most common. The sentences in the arguments follow some very clear patterns that once you get used to it it goes smoothly. It also features more \"advanced\" grammar like what would be considered JLPT N2-N1 but that is actually very easy to understand in context and it's nice to see it applied in an argument. Easy-Medium \u738b\u5973\u69d8\u304c\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u306b\u76e3\u7981\u3055\u308c\u308b\u8a71 Simple writing style, uncomplicated story in a generic fantasy setting. The only thing that stands out is keigo used by one of the MCs and typical fantasy vocabulary. If you're at least a bit familiar with the genre vocabulary though, it'll be an easy read. Easy-Medium \u307c\u304f\u306f\u660e\u65e5\u3001\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u304d\u307f\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b Written for adults so it might be a bit harder vocab-wise though it is still somewhat easy due to being a romance novel. Easy-Medium \u8ee2\u751f\u3057\u305f\u3089\u5263\u3067\u3057\u305f The writing style is easy and pleasant to read, typical isekai vocabulary used but there are also some rare words here and there and you might struggle a bit with skill names because there's no furigana included for most of them. Easy-Medium \u590f\u3078\u306e\u30c8\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3001\u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\u306e\u51fa\u53e3 Good beginner pick, includes some supernatural elements but is quite easy to read. Easy-Medium \u307b\u3046\u304b\u3054\u304c\u304b\u308a The story is set in school, vocabulary thus covers mostly school or slice of life topics, and (rarely) painting. What bumps up the difficulty slightly is the number of characters to track, occasional whole paragraphs dedicated to colorful environment descriptions using longer sentences, and more detailed, albeit rare, character monologues. Easy-Medium \u7425\u73c0\u306e\u79cb\u30010\u79d2\u306e\u65c5 Writing style is not difficult to comprehend, but different locations and prefectures are mentioned throughout the novel so you might feel a bit confused if you don't know Japan's geography at a basic level. Easy-Medium \u534a\u5206\u306e\u6708\u304c\u306e\u307c\u308b\u7a7a There are two versions, the OG from Dengeki, and one released from a non LN label (\u6587\u6625\u6587\u5eab). The original is very easy to read with simple vocab, short sentences, but doesn't have a digital version. The second one has a digital version but it is heavily rewritten with \u4f0a\u52e2\u5f01 into 4 books and no illustrations so it is a bit harder to read than the Dengeki version. Easy-Medium \u7121\u8077\u8ee2\u751f Very simple sentences with a fairly narrow vocabulary considering it's fantasy. Easy-Medium \u9752\u6625\u30d6\u30bf\u91ce\u90ce Very light romance LN with some supernatural elements. Easy-Medium \u30d6\u30ae\u30fc\u30dd\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u7b11\u308f\u306a\u3044 Easy sentences, the vocabulary isn't too difficult either. Easy-Medium \u3072\u3052\u3092\u5243\u308b\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u5973\u5b50\u9ad8\u751f\u3092\u62fe\u3046\u3002 Mostly plain sentences, not too abstract with generous furigana. Easy-Medium \u5973\u540c\u58eb\u3068\u304b\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3068\u8a00\u3044\u5f35\u308b\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3092\u3001\u767e\u65e5\u9593\u3067\u5fb9\u5e95\u7684\u306b\u843d\u3068\u3059\u767e\u5408\u306e\u304a\u8a71 Nothing really stands out except some descriptive terms for colors/clothing may be hard to look up. Easy-Medium \u672c\u597d\u304d\u306e\u4e0b\u524b\u4e0a Has a \u30b8\u30e5\u30cb\u30a2\u6587\u5eab printing which makes it more approachable with a full suite of ruby/furigana thrown in for help, and is written quite approachably. Easy-Medium \u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb\u5f37\u76d7\u304b\u3089\u52a9\u3051\u305f\u5730\u5473\u5e97\u54e1\u304c\u3001\u540c\u3058\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u3046\u3076\u3067\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u30ae\u30e3\u30eb\u3060\u3063\u305f Nothing too difficult here, the grammar is pretty easy overall and the vocab is mostly slice of life stuff. Easy-Medium NHK\u306b\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d! The author likes to use some yoji but other than that nothing too crazy. Easy-Medium \u9b54\u5973\u306e\u65c5\u3005 Books are divided with many different stories. Somewhat easier than \u30ad\u30ce\u306e\u65c5 due to more SoL/Fantasy content/vocab. The writing in first person also makes it easier to get used to. Easy-Medium \u51b4\u3048\u306a\u3044\u5f7c\u5973\u306e\u80b2\u3066\u304b\u305f Standard harem romcom fare with some simple doujinshi vocab. Nothing too bad, could be used as a first light novel. Easy-Medium \u4ffa\u306e\u59b9\u304c\u3053\u3093\u306a\u306b\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u308f\u3051\u304c\u306a\u3044 Overall easy writing style but you might not realize what is an expression/idiom. Easy-Medium \u7070\u3068\u5e7b\u60f3\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30e0\u30ac\u30eb  level.1 \u3055\u3055\u3084\u304d\u3001\u8a60\u5531\u3001\u7948\u308a\u3001\u76ee\u899a\u3081\u3088 Some chuuni vocab and medieval weapons vocabulary. Easy-Medium \u304d\u306e\u3046\u306e\u6625\u3067\u3001\u541b\u3092\u5f85\u3064 The writing style itself is not difficult, but there are lots of time leaps involved so you might get confused by the order of events if you don't follow the story closely. Easy-Medium \u9854\u3055\u3048\u3088\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044\u6559\u5ba4 While this is decently easy, it has a pretty heavy focus on show business/entertainment which makes it slightly harder than a beginner recommendation, but still approachable. Easy-Medium \u6642\u3005\u30dc\u30bd\u30c3\u3068\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u8a9e\u3067\u30c7\u30ec\u308b\u96a3\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30ea\u30e3\u3055\u3093 Surprisingly difficult in terms of sentence length, but nothing else is difficult. The vocabulary is mostly slice of life stuff, the grammar is easy. Medium \u4e18\u306e\u5bb6\u306e\u30df\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u3010\u304a\u304b\u307f\u304d\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3011 Longer sentence length (especially due to the use of parentheses) with some outdated vocabulary from time to time. Medium \u604b\u306b\u81f3\u308b\u75c5 The sentences are easy to read even though it uses some pretty rare vocabulary at times. Medium \u30b5\u30de\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba The sentences are usually long and can be hard to follow for a beginner with some harder vocab from time to time. The story can also be all over the place at least in the first few parts. Medium \u30ce\u30eb\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u306e\u68ee Longer sentence length, pretty long novel too compared to something like light novels. The topic matter is handled in a more indirect manner. Medium \u30ad\u30ce\u306e\u65c5 \u2014the Beautiful World\u2014 The books are divided into small stories with different perspectives and style. Grammar is quite straightforward despite some long monologues here and there but the amount of vocab will pose a challenge. For instance, depending on the story there might be military or scientific vocabulary. Medium \u30a4\u30ea\u30e4\u306e\u7a7a\u3001UFO\u306e\u590f It's not hard to follow but it does have higher vocab than your average LN, the writing is very striking and peculiar so wouldn't recommend it until having read a few other stuff at least. Medium \u3064\u3081\u305f\u3044\u30aa\u30be\u30f3 The writing is very straightforward but it does have some very long sentences and uncommon words here and there (at least compared to random LNs). Medium \u9244\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30a4\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 Same as \u30a4\u30ea\u30e4 above (same writer). Not hard to follow but the writing is very speculiar so you should a few other books first. Medium \u5de6\u5dfb\u30ad\u5f0f\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30be\u30fc\u30c8 Nothing too complicated language-wise but not extremely straightfoward either. Medium Re:\u30bc\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6d3b Average fantasy light novel difficulty. Medium \u6d77\u8fba\u306e\u30ab\u30d5\u30ab Sentences are pretty easy for a literary fiction work. Vocabulary has nothing particularly worth mentioning. Medium \u970a\u5a92\u63a2\u5075\u57ce\u585a\u7fe1\u7fe0 Detailed descriptions of environments and lines of logic that the reader must be able to understand to keep up with the mysteries. Medium \u88cf\u4e16\u754c\u30d4\u30af\u30cb\u30c3\u30af Scifi/scientific concepts and some more advanced vocabulary, but nothing crazy. Medium \u306a\u305c\u30ed\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u306a\u4eba\u306f\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u304c\u5f37\u3044\u306e\u304b\uff1f Average sentences but there are some baseball and mahjong references. Medium \u3084\u306f\u308a\u4ffa\u306e\u9752\u6625\u30e9\u30d6\u30b3\u30e1\u306f\u307e\u3061\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b Quite a few cultural references, especially to Chiba prefecture. The main character is quite cynical and tends to go on somewhat long tirades. Other than this, pretty alright. Medium \u3080\u304b\u3057\u50d5\u304c\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u5bb6 Some vocabulary that's fallen a bit out of use, otherwise relatively straight forward. Medium \u544a\u767d It mixes writing styles across the whole book, with some of them being harder and some being much easier. Medium \u5cb8\u8fba\u9732\u4f34\u306f\u622f\u308c\u306a\u3044 The main character is pretentious and that tone is established in the dialog and descriptions through uncommon words; it's a short story collection so there's a lot of new vocabulary every 60 pages or so. Medium \u7adc\u6bba\u3057\u306e\u30d6\u30ea\u30e5\u30f3\u30d2\u30eb\u30c9 Vocabulary on the more advanced side, fantasy story that can be harder to follow at times, and rare but present more poetic bits. If you're familiar with the prequel, I heard  SukaMoka is about the same difficulty. Not a beginner recommended light novel series. Medium \u97ff\u3051\uff01\u30e6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a9\u4e8c\u30a2\u30e0 Dialogue has written Kansai-ben that might be difficult to get used to and there's lots of music vocab, but it also makes it THE best story for mining music vocab. Medium-Hard \u30ce\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30fb\u30ce\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5 Some characters have very strong dialect or talk in an old fashioned way, writing style is not straightforward, many references to other media can be seen throughout the novel. Medium-Hard \u85ac\u5c4b\u306e\u3072\u3068\u308a\u3054\u3068 Japanese light novel based on a Chinese background, lots of old Japanese vocab is used. Authors employ a wide range of vocab and expressions that add to the difficulty. Even the character names will throw you off because they use the Chinese pronounciation in the furigana instead of Japanese. Medium-Hard \u5200\u8a9e Has some harder words/kanji for ability names and the characters speak in an old fashioned way occasionally, but otherwise very readable. Does include a bunch of wordplay though which intermediate learners and below might not be able to spot. Experience with chuuni style games might make this slightly easier. Medium-Hard \u9b54\u6cd5\u79d1\u9ad8\u6821\u306e\u52a3\u7b49\u751f Complete magic system, protagonists use keigo constantly, lots of fights with difficult vocabualries, extensive descriptions (especially of trains and public transportations for some reason) make this a bit of a tough read for a beginner. Medium-Hard \u5316\u7269\u8a9e Written by Nisioin so expect clever dialogue with word play and a lot of cultural references, making it harder than average to fully comprehend. Medium-Hard Re\uff1a\u30bc\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6d3b Standard isekai and fantasy vocabulary but relatively long sentences with decently hard structures. Takes a bit of time to get used to, Medium-Hard \u604b\u3059\u308b\u5bc4\u751f\u866b The main difficulty is that there are a lot of technical words on pathological conditions and parasites. Medium-Hard \u7f85\u751f\u9580 Old kanji, old grammar make this harder than your average novel, but it is still understandable to more advanced learners. It's a classic for a reason though. Medium-Hard \u5996\u6c1b\u9332\uff08\u4e2d\u5cf6\u6566\uff09 Written in an oldish style, has some hard words, not too difficult to read past that. Extremely short. Hard Fate/Zero Sentences are challenging and the author uses a wide range of vocabulary. Hard \u5e7c\u5973\u6226\u8a18 Challenging isekai light novel involving politics, war and some fantasy elements. Hard \u4eba\u9593\u5931\u683c Old readings that aren't used anymore, old things that aren't common anymore, extremely long phrases where you have to pay attention to the whole sentence to understand anything by the end of it. Old forms of verbs that aren't really used anymore either. Excerpts of translated poetry that you can't find in the original to compare as it's actually a unique interpretation of some japanese writer. Tough read. Hard \u30ed\u30b9\u30b8\u30a7\u30cd\u306e\u9006\u8972 Harder than your average novel. The novel has a lot of formal business, corporate and economic terms. It also has some rare expressions. It can only get difficult due to the words used, other than that the writing style is not hard to follow at all. Recommended to learn formal Japanese words. Hard \u9f3b Old kanji and old kana usage, very specific buddhist vocabulary with older grammar and vocabulary more generally makes this a challenging read. Hard \u540c\u5fd7\u5c11\u5973\u3088\u3001\u6575\u3092\u6483\u3066 Very involved descriptions of historical war tactics, group movements, and general combat lingo are what makes this difficult. The interpersonal and action scenes tend to be a bit easier in comparison. Hard \u574a\u3061\u3083\u3093 Souseki uses a lot of archaic and rare vocabulary, and some of the example sentences used to explain these words come from Souseki himself (!). It's also sometimes hard to discern whether the narrator (or someone else) is speaking. Nonetheless, his writing largely makes up for it. Hard \u6216\u963f\u5446\u306e\u4e00\u751f Shorter than the one above, but extremely abstract with weird pacing due to the disconnected nature of the book. It uses old kanji and kana but the main difficulty is how abstract it all is, rather than the sentence length or anything like that. Hard \u821e\u59eb\uff08\u68ee\u9d0e\u5916\uff09 Vocab isn't too difficult, however it'll be difficult to understand for those not familiar with the style of writing. The story is straight forward and quite short, there's also many \u89e3\u8aac available which makes it a good introduction to \u6587\u8a9e\u9ad4. Hard \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd71-3\uff08\u5409\u5ddd\u82f1\u6cbb\uff09 Uses difficult vocab, but its surprising pleasant to read once you get into it. Difficulty mainly comes from keeping track of what's going on, as the perspective is constantly being changed. Hard-Very Hard \u7fa9\u8840\u4fa0\u8840\uff08\u6cc9\u93e1\u82b1\uff09 Outdated, rare words. The writing is hard to follow in general, especially dialogue. Very Hard \u5341\u4e8c\u652f\u80031-12\uff08\u5357\u65b9\u718a\u6960\uff09 Old, scholarly writing. References many historical documents, books, etc. Hell \u904b\u547d\uff08\u5e78\u7530\u9732\u4f34\uff09 Old. 10/10 vocab difficulty, words that will only show up Chinese dictionaries, made up words, made up \u56db\u5b57\u719f\u8a9e etc, unless you have expansive kanji knowledge it's a struggle. Hard to read in general, especially if you aren't familiar with \u6587\u8a9e\u9ad4, very long sentences. Hell \u53e4\u4e8b\u8a18 \u6821\u8a3b\uff08\u592a\u5b89\u4e07\u4fb6,\u7a17\u7530\u963f\u793c\uff09 Very old style writing, very difficult to decipher. Even with the \u6821\u8a3b, you'll likely finish a section having no idea what you just read. Many difficult words, many gods with long names that are hard to keep track of. There's also quite a bit of poetry that, unless you have experience reading old Japanese poetry, is very hard to understand."},{"location":"tieu-thuyet/#visual-novel","title":"Visual Novel","text":"<ul> <li> <p>T\u1eeb m\u1ed9t ai \u0111\u00f3 kh\u00f4ng r\u00f5, danh s\u00e1ch g\u1ee3i \u00fd VN n\u00ean ch\u01a1i</p> </li> <li> <p>Danh s\u00e1ch VN x\u1ebfp theo \u0111\u1ed9 kh\u00f3 c\u1ee7a Chronopolize</p> </li> <li> <p>M\u1ed9t danh s\u00e1ch g\u1ee3i \u00fd VN kh\u00e1c</p> </li> <li> <p>Visual Novel Database</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"youtube/","title":"Youtube","text":"<p>B\u1ea3ng g\u1ed1c \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c l\u1ea5y t\u1eeb Website c\u1ee7a Ixrec, b\u1ea1n c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 truy c\u1eadp trang g\u1ed1c t\u1ea1i \u0111\u00e2y. \u1ede \u0111\u00e2y m\u00ecnh c\u00f3 b\u1ed5 sung th\u00eam m\u1ed9t s\u1ed1 c\u00e1c k\u00eanh kh\u00e1c m\u00e0 b\u1ea1n c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 s\u1ebd mu\u1ed1n xem.</p> Channel Name Genre Description Picture \u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30df\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u00a0FermiLab Miscellaneous They add voice over manga panels and make a video out of it.

Fischer's Miscellaneous One of Japan's most popular YouTube channels.
