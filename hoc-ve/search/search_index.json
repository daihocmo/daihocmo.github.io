You may feel confident after you do a drawabox lesson, but until you can actually bring what you learned into your arsenal of tools, you will probably want to reinforce it. So get ready to go back and redo those \"lessons\" over and over.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write stuff down: Whether it's small goals for the next attempt at a subject, insight you don't want to forget, or just trying to break bad habits. Write these information so you don't lose it! I usually go check the last notes I had to see what I need to do next.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't ignore studying anime: As long as you are not doodling, you can learn plenty with studying anime as a topic for just about anything (including those \"fundamentals\"). You may want to allocate more time/resource at learning from realism but the end goal here is to spend almost all time at stylized.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the easiest technique: If you aren't exercising a specific technique, don't limit yourself to that one. For example, if you're drawing a body part that's in a difficult perspective making construction difficult, just simply don't use construction you could easily get away with just enveloping the area, using pos/neg shapes and landmarks to draw it instead.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Personal opinion:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Construction is excellent at training muscle memory and draftsmanship. However, the initial exercises teaches you to \"zoom in/focus\" on marks (whether to create a straight line, ellipse, etc) and you need to break this habit.</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a skill at making an art look good enough, sometimes you can just bullshit it correctly (whether it's millions of ctrl + z or just getting away with a mistake), there is a lot of different ways to make a part of drawing believable, each time you successfully do it, you sort of add it to your memory and can recall what might work and get away with it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Recommended resources:</p> <p>/ic/'s beginner document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uwaXKU7ev6Tw_or__o8ARpUb6r2rCZYJGqwSFV9AD98/edit#bookmark=id.15jx3pyuimvj</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY-tGAhulrOzRd6n1mLZwSg/videos (Jp with eng subs, simplified contents to show beginner vs pro difference)</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYuHKwhgfCighvhR3n151w/videos (jp no subs, anime gesture/perspective/anatomy, recommended to turn subs on cc and follow the videos as best as you can)</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDtAvTQ71BkcCS5CP7kbAeA/videos (kr no subs, art academy focused on anime, just see generalized techniques not too much content here; they also have twitter)</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/user/Newey02/videos (kr artist, explains anatomy, general process in simplified manner that you can kinda watch on)</p> <p>https://a-naf.tumblr.com/post/166379294081/im-a-big-fan-of-your-art-man-you-are-really (Deeper insight on what sort of direction to take to get some results)</p> <p>https://ichi-up.net/categories/%E6%8F%8F%E3%81%8D%E6%96%B9 (JP site with how to tutorials on specific anime related problems, (Just right click translate to get the gist of the tutorial), their beginner level materials are simplified with just straight up solutions to common issues, why does my face look \"bad\" simplified perspective solution)</p>"},{"location":"resources/","title":"T\u00e0i nguy\u00ean h\u1ecdc","text":"<p>Ngu\u1ed3n: \u0110\u1ecdc tr\u00ean Reddit t\u1ea1i \u0111\u00e2y</p> <p>So, I made this post because I wanted to share my progress, and also post resources that would hopefully offer value to others. Along the past 3 months, I've discovered some excellent sources from learning, of which I'll list here. I'll start with the ones I'm actively using:</p> <p>\u200b</p> <ul> <li>Proko: Figure Drawing Fundamentals Class (free on Youtube!)</li> <li>Drawabox.com (free!)<ul> <li>Drawabox is a homework-based, drill-type approach to solidifying your understanding of 3d forms and construction drawing. I've since learned a lot of this stems from Scott Robertson's book, \"How to Draw\".</li> </ul> </li> <li>\"How to Draw\", by Scott Robertson<ul> <li>One of the concept art industry gods. Taught Feng Zhu, a highly-regarded concept artist who runs a school out in Singapore. Teaches construction of man-made objects in perspective.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Moderndayjames<ul> <li>Simplifies and condenses many concept art fundamentals, as well as general fundamentals of all illustration. His \"Perspective\" series is all ripped straight from Scott Robertson's \"How to Draw\", but makes it much easier to understand visually. Highly recommended!</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Now, for more resources:</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"resources/#youtube-channels","title":"Youtube Channels:","text":"<ul> <li>Ahmed Aldoori</li> <li>Austin Batchelor (the best Procreate painting tutorials out there. has fantastic courses on Udemy)</li> <li>The Art of Aaron Blaise (legendary animator of Disney Studios)</li> <li>BAM Animation</li> <li>Blender Guru (specifically his series on Light and Color)</li> <li>Bobby Chiu (creator of Schoolism)</li> <li>Brad Colbow (stop here to learn everything you need to know for Procreate)</li> <li>Brooke Eggleston's Character School</li> <li>Chris Oatley</li> <li>Croquis Cafe (intended to simulate live model drawing.

Hopefully some people can find this of value. I plan to work my way through everything as I go on, and eventually be a kick-butt illustrator making my own comic books and children's books. The wealth of information out there is just incredible. It's super exciting that we can all go find resources like this for ourselves, and act on it. I'm confident that all of these resources is enough to counter any sort of private art university.</p> <p>All it takes is sitting down, and drawing.</p> <p>Thanks for your time, guys!</p>"},{"location":"roadmap/","title":"Roadmap","text":""}]}
