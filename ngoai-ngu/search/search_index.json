In this article, we will look in more detail at what active immersion is and how to practice it. We will also discuss the different types of active immersion, and how to deal with the ambiguity that can arise when immersing.</p>"},{"location":"active/#what-is-active-immersion","title":"What is active immersion","text":"<p>Active immersion is the most crucial element in language learning. During active immersion, you are paying your full attention to the material you are consuming, be it audio, video, or text.</p> <p>It is where language acquisition really takes place. Your attention alerts the brain, allowing it to start detecting patterns and make guesses. Even if the material is mostly incomprehensible, your mind is still working hard trying to find language patterns, become accustomed to the sounds, constructing a model of the language.</p> <p>It can even be argued that doing active immersion alone is sufficient to become fluent. Of course, passive immersion helps, but it is not imperative. One can also stop using the SRS and still reach fluency, although it will take longer. But without active immersion everything falls apart. As we know very well from experiences of other people, just memorizing words and grammar is not going to lead anywhere.</p>"},{"location":"active/#starting-to-immerse","title":"Starting to immerse","text":"<p>It is vital to discover content that captures your interest. Explore the available content in your target language, experiment with different media, different genres. To be able to immerse for hours and hours every day, the content must be \"compelling\", as Steven Krashen often calls it. You have a long journey of learning ahead of you, so it's essential to have a strong passion and enthusiasm for something in the language. Only compelling content will be able to captivate you and hold your attention.</p> <p>Most people before they start AJATT already have a passion for otaku content, such as anime, manga, ranobe, or other types of Japanese media. For them, learning Japanese provides an opportunity to further enjoy and appreciate the media they love.</p> <p>It takes\u00a0thousands of hours\u00a0of watching, listening, and reading in the target language to become fluent. The more you immerse, the faster you progress. To maximize progress, exposure to the target language should be maximized while exposure to other languages should be minimized. In AJATT, we advise that you start immersing as much as possible from the beginning. Active and passive immersion combined\u00a0should take up\u00a0more than 12 hours a day in order to make rapid progress.</p> <p>If a chosen immersion medium becomes boring, then let it go and move on to something more stimulating, something else that seems fun. A new anime, a new manga. To maintain motivation to learn your target language, keep engaging with interesting content.</p> <p>We have compiled a list of places where one can find immersion content to make it easy for beginners to get started.\u00a0Click here\u00a0to explore it.</p>"},{"location":"active/#dealing-with-ambiguity","title":"Dealing with ambiguity","text":"<p>When beginning to learn a new language, you're going to consume unfamiliar content that may seem impossible to understand at first. For a while, you're going to have to deal with not understanding or not understanding everything. However, it is important to acknowledge that this is a natural part of the language acquisition process and to remind yourself that it is only temporary.</p> <p>Accept that for a while you won't be understanding much. While immersing, you're actually learning all the time. Your brain does most of the work\u00a0subconsciously. It learns to parse the sounds, notice and recognize words, infer meaning from the context. Additionally, analyzing the material and doing dictionary lookups can further aid in the learning process.</p> <p>To quickly expand your vocabulary and overcome the initial challenges, for the first few months we recommend learning from our\u00a0pre-made Anki deck. This deck is thoroughly explained\u00a0later, and will help you reach a comprehension rate of 75%, making immersion easier and more enjoyable down the road.</p> <p>To help yourself during the early stages of language learning, you can watch\u00a0TV shows and movies\u00a0with\u00a0subtitles in the target language, although\u00a0not all the time, as developing your listening ability is also important.</p> <p>There are several reasons why TV and movies with\u00a0TL\u00a0subtitles are an excellent choice. The visuals can provide additional context which aids comprehension. Additionally, you can hear the proper pronunciation of the words you are reading. As you hear the subtitles spoken aloud, through pauses and intonation, you can better interpret the sentence structure and parse the clauses. Finally, the language in TV and movies is generally simpler than books, blogs, or news articles.</p> <p>The lack of understanding can lead to a feeling of despondency. You may want to turn on English subtitles or subtitles in your native language. Don't do it because\u00a0watching with English subs doesn't work. Trust the process of immersion.</p> <p>You can also immerse in content you have consumed before in another language. For example, if you have watched a lot of translated anime before starting to learn Japanese, now you can\u00a0rewatch\u00a0them in Japanese. Since you already know the plot, it will help you understand the shows in another language. For shows that you have not watched yet, reading synopsis before or after watching will help you understand the story better.</p> <p>In order to remain engaged and maintain motivation, it is probably not a good idea to watch content twice. Doing so can increase one's comprehension due to prior knowledge of the plot, however, it can also be quite boring and tedious. Rather, consider re-listening to what you have already actively watched\u00a0during passive immersion. This way you don't waste your active immersion hours on repetition.</p> <p>When first getting started, things like science fiction or fantasy novels will be too difficult to read. Choosing content that has\u00a0simpler language\u00a0is another great technique for beginners. For example, slice of life shows or romantic comedies can be a good choice. However, avoid content made for children as it is often not enjoyable for adults. The language is too simple even for a beginner language learner. The plot is too silly and dumbed down. After learning your first 1,000 words from a pre-made Anki deck, you won't need to restrict yourself so much, as\u00a0frontloading\u00a0vocabulary in the beginning greatly improves comprehension.</p>"},{"location":"active/#types-of-active-immersion","title":"Types of active immersion","text":"<p>Learners often wonder\u00a0how often they should look up words while actively immersing. You can look up every word and strive to comprehend 100% of the material, look up nothing and just let your brain slowly absorb the language, or try to balance the two. In practice, trying to decide when to look up and when not to look up can be tiresome and lead to decision fatigue. Do you look up every Nth unknown word? Or do you look up every N minutes? Do you have to measure the time? There are many uncertainties. Rather than trying to find a center point between the two extremes, it is recommended that you carry them out as separate exercises,\u00a0intensive\u00a0and\u00a0free-flow\u00a0immersion.</p>"},{"location":"active/#intensive-immersion","title":"Intensive immersion","text":"<p>When you look up everything trying to comprehend 100%, it is known as intensive immersion. During intensive immersion you're in a more conscious mode where you're thoroughly analyzing the language as you're going. As you immerse, you are carefully examining the language, utilizing dictionary lookups to decipher the meaning of each sentence, and creating SRS cards to ensure that you don't forget what you have learned.</p> <p>Intensive immersion is the most effective way to notice, save, and memorize new words. It is, however, a mentally demanding activity. Our daily cognitive resources are finite, and staying focused requires lots of energy. To maximize the benefits of immersion, it is advisable to engage in intensive immersion when you are feeling more refreshed and alert, switching to free-flow immersion when your cognitive capacities are depleted.</p> <p>A plethora of tools exist to facilitate intensive immersion, There are dictionary apps, browser extensions, mpv plugins, etc. They make it effortless to look up words and create SRS cards during immersion.</p> <p>In the beginning, you won't always be able to fully understand every single sentence during intensive immersion. You may not be able to understand some sentences even with the aid of a dictionary. This is to be expected. If a sentence is too difficult to understand or there are too many unfamiliar words, it is best to save it for later in Anki and come back to it in a few weeks, or even months. It is better to focus on the simpler phrases first, the things your mind is ready to absorb. As your comprehension grows, the formerly challenging language will become easier and easier.</p>"},{"location":"active/#free-flow-immersion","title":"Free flow immersion","text":"<p>If you sit all day and mine sentences, you're going to lose your mind, or die from exhaustion. Free-flow immersion is when you allow yourself to relax without having to mine or look up words, while still paying attention to the content. You don't disrupt the flow with pausing and lookups. Instead, you're embracing ambiguity and letting your subconscious take the lead and interpret what is being said on its own. Free-flow immersion is a mid-ground between passive immersion and intensive immersion.</p> <p>Free-flow immersion may seem relatively ineffective, but this is far from the truth. Your comprehension will continue to improve as you infer meanings from the context. Even minor details can improve your understanding. As your level of comprehension further grows, this form of immersion becomes increasingly important and helps you make faster progress.</p> <p>The more things you can do in free-flow, the closer you are in a way to a native. So it's necessary to cultivate this skill. As you know, natives don't spend time analyzing every sentence, and they don't sit with a dictionary checking new words, they absorb the language gradually.</p> <p>When I was learning Japanese, I did a lot of free-flow immersion, even during my early stages as a beginner and lower intermediate learner. One of my preferred methods was watching ongoing anime. As is common with such shows, they are often not readily available with Japanese subtitles, and so I opted to watch them in their raw, unsubbed form rather than waiting for the subtitles.</p> <p>Remember, we all learned our native language entirely through free-flow immersion, so I believe that free-flow immersion is more important than intensive immersion in the grand scheme of things. Intensive immersion, on the other hide, is great for expanding your vocabulary.</p> <p>During free-flow immersion, it is a good idea to try to understand without relying on TL subtitles. Listening practice is imperative for achieving all around fluency.</p>"},{"location":"active/#finding-the-ratio","title":"Finding the ratio","text":"<p>Every day, you are supposed to be engaging in passive, free-flow, and intensive immersion. All three play a role in the process of language acquisition. It is easy to determine when to do each one; passive immersion is best when you are occupied with something, intensive immersion is the best option when you have the energy and motivation to look up words, and free-flow immersion is the best choice when you are too tired for intensive immersion.</p> <p>As mentioned briefly above, we recommend selecting some content for free-flow immersion and other content for intensive immersion. For instance, if you're watching an anime series, you could watch one episode in free-flow, and then switch to intensive mode for the following episode. Alternately, you could watch one series in free-flow, and another in intensive mode. It is best if the genres are alike, so that the language in both shows is similar, and you gain more exposure to the same vocabulary.</p> <p>One thing about free flow immersion is that a lot of times some words that don't show up extremely frequently will go unnoticed, and you won't pick them up. Thus, it is vital to practice intensive immersion to close the gap between our lexicon and that of a native speaker. As we don't have 20 years of time to acquire all the vocabulary naturally, through free-flow immersion alone. We have to use dictionaries and create SRS cards in order to really expand our vocabulary. The best way to do this is to read extensively.</p>"},{"location":"anki/","title":"Anki c\u00e1c th\u1ee9","text":""},{"location":"anki/#beginners-guide","title":"Beginner's Guide","text":"<p>For Anki beginners, habit &amp; friction is your enemy.

If you're coming here fresh to the endeavour, you've got a lot to cover, but we promise the effort will be worth the reward!</p> <p>We serve as a hub to help you find all the great communities and resources that are out there</p> <p>We share advice and tips that apply to all languages</p> <p>When it comes to your specific language, there are lots of great places to find resources and get support. The best place to start is with the language subreddits. Check out the Resources wiki for some resources and links to language subreddits. If you'd like to know how we recommend you start learning a language, you can start with the guide below.</p> <p>There's a fair amount to cover, so to make it as easy as possible one of our mods has organised everything into a guide. The guide has two formats: an online version and a PDF. The content is almost entirely the same, but the online version is updated more frequently.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#whats-in-the-guide","title":"What's in the guide?","text":"<p>There are lots of guides out there in the internet, so why did we need another one? Most guides out there are very theoretical. They talk a lot about language learning theory or dispense a smattering of advice without covering the breadth of any one topic. Theory is important, but it can also be very lengthy. Oftentimes, the learner is still left wondering \"ok great, so I think I understand how to learn, but what do I actually do to start? What resources should I use? What should my routine be?\". Here we take the position that understanding the basic steps to learning a language is far more important for a beginner than dealing with lots of theory.</p> <p>To help you best, the subreddit guide is structured as follows:</p> <p>The start contains a bare minimum of theory, covering only the basics you really need to know before you begin. The guide then focuses on helping you find resources. You will review the types of resources you need to start and where to find them. The guide then helps you put everything together, covering your routine with some advice on ensuring you learn as fast as you can.</p> <p>After that, the book covers more core language learning theory:</p> <p>You will be shown how to use your resources optimally. You will then cover more broad language learning theory, such as how best to learn grammar, vocabulary, and the four skills.</p> <p>From there, the guide moves on to more intermediate topics, including great intermediate activities and advice for studying without a course. The end of the guide has a large set of appendices to provide additional information and respond to common queries. Beginners don't need to read this far.</p> <p>If you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content or advice here, we recommend you just start your language. Most of us who have been here a while or started before language learning on the internet was possible had to figure out what works for ourselves, and we've done just fine. Ultimately, if you're engaging with the language and enjoying it, you are already most of the way there.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#immersion","title":"Immersion","text":"<p>Immersion is probably the best approach to learning a foreign language, but also one that requires much time and effort. It is more than simply watching foreign movies or visiting particular websites. As the word itself suggests, you must be completely absorbed in the language. Therefore, your success will highly depend on how much you can dedicate yourself to it.</p> <p>If you are able to live in a foreign country, for example, this approach will benefit you tremendously, since you will be forced to use the language to accomplish even the most basic tasks and, with time, this will effectively hardwire the language to your brain.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, you plan on just watching a movie every now and then, then the effects of this approach will be close to negligible.</p> <p>Immersion works because, given enough exposure, the brain is able to identify patterns (such as grammar) subconsciously. However in order to do that it needs constant exposure, whether that be by books, movies, or talking to native speakers, it just needs to be immersed. The more exposure you can get, the faster you will learn.</p> <p>So if you are able to immerse yourself in a language, I highly recommend this approach as it is very beneficial and rewarding.</p> <p>I think the only thing I could say is focus on listening and absorbing the language, don't worry so much about speaking it until you feel ready (unless the group has specific expectations for you as a participant I suppose)</p> <p>This is a super specific situation though so there is probably way more you can learn from people at the event than anyone here. Ask others who speak it as a 2nd language for their advice, and gather any resources you can, be they recordings, self-published books or out of print books, whatever exists for the language. But really, just take the advice of folks around you, keep learning about the culture, and be as patient with yourself as you can. This sounds like a really special experience and opportunity</p>"},{"location":"guide/#tips-to-start","title":"Tips to start","text":"<p>I\u2019m of the idea to start immersing as soon as possible using only content I want to immerse in (not graded readers for example)\u2026usually within the first month of learning, but it\u2019s all depending on your patience, motivation and plan.</p> <p>Patience: when you start immersing early, you need to understand that you won\u2019t understand much\u2026if that makes any sense\u2026and that per sentence you will take some time to understand parts of it and that sometimes you won\u2019t understand all of it\u2026and that\u2019s ok\u2026just move on\u2026avoid using translation tools as you miss a lot because translations are rarely one to one</p> <p>Motivation: what\u2019s your motivation? When you start immersing early on you have to ensure you have a solid motivation\u2026.because it can be easy to get frustrated\u2026having a solid motivation will help you get past beginning stages</p> <p>Plan: don\u2019t just start listening or reading something without understanding and call that immersion\u2026because you will not have learned anything. You have to do what\u2019s called comprehensible input and depending on how far your NL is from your TL, you may need to use anki to practice unknown words.</p> <p>Also, depending on the differences between NL and TL, you may a need to learn pronunciation before starting to immerse. And maybe very, very basic grammar (I usually just buy a beginner grammar book and use anki to memorize beginner level grammar before starting immersion)</p> <p>If the NL is very different from the TL, I typically start only reading after learning basic grammar and pronunciation\u2026then about a year later I start listening.</p> <p>With time, patience and dedication, you can get far\u2026but keep in mind this route is not easy\u2026not everyone can start immersing like this in a new language without quitting soon after\u2026if you dont think this path is for you you could always do a bit more structured learning before doing immersion and then do graded reading\u2026I just personally find that approach boring\u2026</p>"},{"location":"input/","title":"H\u01b0\u1edbng d\u1eabn","text":"<p>It works. However, I want to note that it's very easy to get lost trying to find input sources that are actually at your level. Instead of spending hours upon hours searching for that perfect show/cartoon where people speak precisely at the level that you can understand, it's better to just pick something that seems interesting to you and just watch it even if it happens to be way above your level. Otherwise chances are you'll just end up not watching anything at all. Either way you're not gonna understand a damn thing in the beginning, so don't sweat the small details too much.</p> <p>If you do want a recommendation for a beginner-friendly show, I've yet to find anything better than \u697d\u3057\u3044\u30e0\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u4e00\u5bb6. It's even easier to understand than shows like Pokemon. And it's also really good.</p> <p>Also, don't make the mistake of thinking you can get away with not reading. Most of your vocabulary gain is gonna be through the written medium.

Kindle e-readers are awesome to read on when it comes to learning a new language, because you can look up the definition / meaning of a word just with a simple touch. What's more, the Kindle e-readers have a built-in vocabulary builder that's supposed to help you retain the words you looked up.</p> <p>However, I don't think the built-in vocabulary reader is enough for people wanting to learn in earnest, for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>no proper SRS</li> <li>no ability to shadow</li> <li>can't create custom flashcards</li> <li>no possible to study on other support</li> <li>limit in the number of words (about 2000) you can look up before older ones are deleted</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <p>I know multiple tools exist that try to solve some of those pain points, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Kindle Mate: No longer maintained, only works on Windows, no built-in SRS.</li> <li>Fluent Cards: Only exports lookups to Anki.</li> <li>... and several other small tools</li> </ul> <p>I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a tool that would try and solve the problems I mentioned above, and more.</p> <p>I've set up a landing page with what I had in mind and would love to get your thoughts.</p> <p>When I read on Kindle I highlight the sentence of words I look up, then export a file of the highlights.

Being aware of language domains helps find the most optimal path to fluency.</p>"},{"location":"language-domain/#what-is-a-domain","title":"What is a domain?","text":"<p>A domain is a subset of the target language that is characterized by frequent use of certain vocabulary. Such vocabulary is often specific to the domain and is used noticeably more than in other areas of the language, in other domains. Words that are commonly used in one domain tend to be less frequently used in other domains.</p> <p>Here are some examples of language domains:</p> <ul> <li>Everyday conversation, real life conversation. This domain includes vocabulary related to talking about nothing. For example, asking \"how are you?\" or chatting about the weather. Real life conversation is different from scripted, edited, and acted content.</li> <li>Slice of life drama, anime, movies, etc. Everyday conversation, but scripted, more detailed, more structured. May include common words from a variety of other domains. Often covers topics related to household, school, work, and more.</li> <li>Various fiction genres, each genre representing its own domain. We encounter fiction in the form of drama, anime, movies, etc.<ul> <li>Science fiction.</li> <li>Fantasy.</li> <li>Business and finance.</li> <li>Sports.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Non-fiction. For example, documentaries.</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, any language can be easily divided into numerous domains. This list can be\u00a0further expanded or modified.</p> <p>Generally, the more a genre deviates from everyday conversation, the less comprehensible it is going to be in the beginning. The medium in which content is presented or recorded also influences the level of difficulty. Usually, books are more challenging than comic books, and comic books are more challenging than movies and TV shows.</p> <p>Another factor to consider is dialect. Many languages, including Japanese, have regional dialects that can significantly differ from one another. Differences in accents alone can make the language incomprehensible, even to native speakers. In some cases, two dialects can be so distinct that they are considered separate languages.</p>"},{"location":"language-domain/#role-of-domains","title":"Role of domains","text":"<p>Why do we need to care about domains? Because the fastest way to obtain high-level comprehension in your target language is to narrow your\u00a0immersion\u00a0focus to a particular domain of the TL, master that subset, then move to another domain and repeat. On the opposite, frequently\u00a0jumping between different domians\u00a0will cause a lot of frustration and slow down your progress since each new domain will meet you with a load of unfamiliar words.</p> <p>It's more efficient to master a small set of domains first, taking one domain at a time, than tackle many domains at the same time and have a bad time immersing in either of them. Immersing oneself in one domain at a time creates a natural spaced repetition environment. You frequently encounter the same words used in different contexts. This helps you memorize the words better in addition to using the\u00a0SRS.</p> <p>Another reason why domains are important is that you want to avoid content that is way above your current skill level. Choose immersion content that is not too difficult but is challenging enough to learn something new from it and grow your ability.</p>"},{"location":"language-domain/#first-domain","title":"First domain","text":"<p>When you start to immerse for the first time, you know nothing, so naturally you need content for beginners, an easy domain to immerse in. Choose content with a simple story. A slice of life anime is going to be easier to follow than a science fiction TV show about time travel.</p> <p>Mastering your first domain will give you ground to expand from. It makes sense to choose something scripted and centered around everyday conversation. On this site we recommend starting with\u00a0slice of life anime and TV shows. Visual content is easier than just audio or just text because it shows you the story instead of only telling you. In addition, anime is easy to understand because it is voiced by professional voice actors who typically speak clearly and use the standard Japanese dialect. This ensures that you're learning from high-quality, accurate sources of spoken Japanese. Slice of life is a good genre to pick first because it is stripped of specialized vocabulary (<code>\u5c02\u9580\u7528\u8a9e</code>). Specialized vocabulary that is unique to a particular field will pose a challenge at this stage. For example, if you're not fluent in Japanese yet, try to watch shows about baseball and see how crazy it gets.</p>"},{"location":"language-domain/#what-to-do-with-domains","title":"What to do with domains","text":"<p>Be aware of them, particularly in the initial stages of language learning.

When you move from one domain to another, take into account how \"far away\" it is from the domains you already know. To optimize your journey towards fluency and flatten the learning curve, it is advisable to gradually progress from easier to more challenging language.

One of the most important parts of AJATT is immersing yourself in Japanese as close to 24 hours a day as possible, combining that with spaced repetition and other technology.</p> <p>Immersion is quite important, we already know that. Let's figure out how much immersion is necessary.</p> <p>Listening, listening, listening. Lots and lots of listening. Like, hundreds and thousands of hours of listening.</p> <p>\u2014 Khatz</p> <p>Traditional language learners think of Japanese as an activity that you do separate from the rest of your life. You have your life which is done in your native language and then you\u00a0study Japanese\u00a0for a certain amount of time. Once you're done, you go back to the world of your native language to do something else.</p> <p>But All Japanese All The Time says that Japanese\u00a0is the ground. That is your life. You live your life in Japanese. You might take a break from that to do something in English or another language for a little, but as soon as you finish that, you go back to Japanese. Khatzumoto said that language is not a hotel, it's a home. You move into it. You don't just chill there for a week and go back to your old home.</p> <p>The mindset of taking any crack in your life and seeing that as an opportunity to study Japanese is at the core. If you adopt this mindset, almost all your time can be spent immersing. This is what leads to the most progress. People learn their native language because it's there. It's the only reason. They live in the language and absorb it. You don't have to choose what to do in Japanese and what to do in another language. There is only one option.</p> <p>There are countless opportunities to immerse throughout a day. If you lead a busy life, you can still find plenty of time when you're idling or waiting for something. Just take that to the extreme. You can do Japanese in the shower, as you're getting ready, while taking a walk, driving, going somewhere, cooking meals, on the bus, on the subway, while exercising, etc. No matter what type of lifestyle you have, you should be able to fit in multiple hours a day of immersion, mainly through listening. Fill every single crack in your life with Japanese. Every waking moment counts. Put your computer's\u00a0operating system into Japanese. Only watch Japanese movies. Get the Japanese dubs of western shows you plan to watch. If you are learning about something, get a book about it in Japanese. Just do whatever you would be doing anyway, but do it in Japanese.</p> <p>Some people are averse to immersion because they don't understand Japanese yet. They decide to study more grammar and vocabulary to strengthen their understanding and some day finally be ready to start immersing. If you are considering putting aside immersion for later, think about the following. No one says, \"I'm going to stop using training wheels once I can ride without them\". You first take them off. But you often hear, \"I'm going to watch an anime without subtitles once I'm fluent.\" This makes no sense because the only way you're going to get fluent is through watching anime without subtitles. Start watching\u00a0anime\u00a0in Japanese from day one. Keep doing that, and you will get fluent. You don't learn a language, you acquire it, absorb it, get used to it. The more you do it, the easier it gets.</p> <p>Building a foundation in grammar and vocabulary through traditional study is extremely helpful, and this is what we are going to be doing a lot in the beginning, but study and immersion have to be done together.</p> <p>We all have jobs, go to school, or have something else we just can't do in Japanese. I believe these things are not obstacles to learning a foreign language. I started AJATT when I was in university, and my degree had nothing to do with Japanese. In fact, Japanese was kind of my way of taking a break from the studies. I just watched anime to chill after university, and I learned Japanese that way. Every day finish what you have to do, and come back to your Japanese\u00a0home.</p> <p>Of course, there are people who just can't find the time. They say, \"Your method is wrong because I don't have enough time to do it\". No one claims that you should be able to master another language in a relatively short amount of time while working on it as a side project. Fluency is something you have to invest in.</p> <p>Getting fluent in Japanese takes around\u00a0<code>10,000</code>\u00a0hours. Most people don't put in even a fraction of that time or use very inefficient methods, that's why they never get good. Therefore, how many hours you immerse each day determines how fast you accomplish the goal. If you immerse\u00a0<code>18</code>\u00a0hours a day, it's going to take you\u00a0<code>1.5</code>\u00a0years to amass those\u00a0<code>10,000</code>\u00a0hours. Sometimes we call the first\u00a0<code>10,000</code>\u00a0hours \"hardcore phase\" because you are supposed to be cramming as much immersion as possible every day during that time. The more you expose yourself to the language, the better. It really just comes down to a matter of time.</p> <p>Immerse\u00a0actively\u00a0when you can. Immerse passively to compensate for those times when you are busy. Assuming you lead a normal lifestyle, spend maybe 3 to 6 hours a day actively doing something in Japanese whether that is reading a book, watching anime or a Japanese TV show, without subtitles or with Japanese subtitles. Of course you should do more if you have the time. Spend another hour or so reviewing flashcards. Keep Japanese playing in the background as much as possible while you are doing chores, homework, etc. Just do whatever you can to get to the ideal of\u00a0<code>18</code>\u00a0hours a day.</p> <p>The bottom line is that If you don't spend thousands of hours with the language, you're not going to get fluent in it.</p>"},{"location":"other-things/","title":"Nh\u1eefng th\u1ee9 kh\u00e1c","text":"<p>T\u1ea1i sao \"\u0110\u1ea7u v\u00e0o d\u1ec5 hi\u1ec3u\" l\u1ea1i hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3?</p> <p>C\u00f3 ng\u01b0\u1eddi th\u00ec Immersion (\u0110\u1eafm m\u00ecnh trong ng\u00f4n ng\u1eef) c\u00f3 ng\u01b0\u1eddi th\u00ec ch\u1ecdn h\u01b0\u1edbng ti\u1ebfp thu d\u1ea7n ngo\u1ea1i ng\u1eef theo Comprehensible Input.</p>"},{"location":"overview/","title":"T\u1ed5ng quan","text":"<p>Tr\u00edch d\u1eabn t\u1eeb b\u00e0i vi\u1ebft c\u1ee7a Donkuri</p>"},{"location":"overview/#immersion","title":"Immersion","text":""},{"location":"overview/#thoughts-on-immersion-and-learning-as-a-whole","title":"Thoughts on immersion and learning as a whole","text":"<p>In this section, I would like to discuss immersion as a whole.

The best way to setup a routine is to use (micro)habits, a concept I learned from this book. Start with simple habits and build on them progressively.

I suggest picking up two at the very least: a reading-based one and a listening-based one. Of all the choices above, my favorite for a beginner is visual novels.</p> <p>The reason I prefer visual novels over basically any other kind of medium is due to how complete it is: you get a picture, a complete sentence and voiced audio (usually) at the same time, so it's nice to look at, you are reading and listening at the same time and the progress is easy to track due to the game nature of a visual novel (usually abbreviated VN). One big caveat is that most visual novels are for adults due to varying amounts of sexual content in them. Some very popular visual novels have none, and there are all-ages version as well. Overall, visual novels are fun, exciting and great for immersion. On that note, do notice that most visual novels will require you to run them with a Japanese locale. You can use Locale Emulator to avoid changing your system settings or you can create shortcuts with this tool.</p> <p>This is not to say that other immersion materials are bad however, quite the opposite in fact. Ideally, you would expose yourself to a wide variety of Japanese reading and listening, from visual novels and Wikipedia articles to classics, anime and newspaper articles.

You shouldn't fail an Anki card just because you did the wrong pitch. Instead, simply re-read the word with correct pitch and move on.

That being said, it is only through practical use of the language (be it via input or output) that you will truly internalize them and become fluent. In other words, grammar is useful because it lets us articulate how and why the language works, but it is not actually the language per se: It is simply an analysis of the inner workings of the language. What this means for most people is that we should be familiar with basic grammar patterns at the very least, with further grammar study done periodically as one encounters new grammar structures through immersion. Nothing wrong with going all in with grammar either and reading everything in IMABI though.

That will help massively because many words, even those less commonly used, have a good chance of being fairly transparent.</p> <p>Here's a random Wikipedia exerpt in Spanish, I'm sure most non-hispanophones will manage to recognize a good chunk of the words, even if it might not be enough to get the general meaning of the sentence:</p> <p>El cuerpo c\u00f3nico del saxof\u00f3n le otorga propiedades m\u00e1s similares a las del oboe que al clarinete. El dise\u00f1o m\u00e1s simple del saxof\u00f3n es un tubo recto troncoc\u00f3nico y los saxofones sopranino y soprano tienen, por lo general, este dise\u00f1o recto.</p> <p>Now a sentence from the same article in the Gaelic version:</p> <p>Gl\u00e9as aonfheag ceoil, d\u00e9anta as miotal le cr\u00f3 leathan c\u00f3nach, cos\u00fail leis an sacschorn.</p> <p>Have fun lol.</p> <p>Learning by reading books once you read a basic intermediate level works well for \"easier\" languages such as Spanish, French, Italian or maybe even German and other relatively close languages (from the perspective of an English speaker, of course). If you try to learn a very exotic language it's probably going to be very frustrating unless you target very simple literature aimed at children.</p> <p>The author acknowledges that, but then goes on to say things like:</p> <p>With the reading speed of 200 words per minutes (which is comfortable enough: I tend to read English at 295 wpm, and English is far from being my native language), it would take you 150 minutes a day (2.5 hours) to process all this beauty in a year.</p> <p>Then goes on to say that it's too much reading, which is true, but even beyond that you really expect to be able to real ~200wpm in a foreign language without already being at a very high level of fluency? Nonsense. My girlfriend is easily C1 in English but she still sometimes has to pause when we watch something with English subtitles so that she can catch up. When learning a language you'll probably take 15minutes to read a single page and you'll be exhausted by the end. If you can cruise at 200wpm reading in a foreign language then congrats, you're fluent. Many less educated native speakers probably read slower than that.</p> <p>I personally find that in general reading newspaper articles is easier and potentially more useful if literature is just too frustrating. Newspaper articles have a few advantages for a learner:</p> <pre><code>They're usually fairly short, it's not a big commitment\nThey favor clarity and simplicity over style. No fancy turns of phrases, no obscure synonyms to avoid repetitions. They're generally written in formal but not bookish register, the same way the native speakers of the language would speak in a formal context (not true for all languages and cultures, admittedly).\nThey focus on a given subject which makes it easier to guess what something means from context. In a book an author could be describing a battlefield and then suddenly talk about what the character ate for breakfast or how about how much they like Ray Charles. A news article will typically focus on a single topic.\nSimilarly the focus on a single topic and the need for clarity means that the same key words are often repeated many time which helps memorization.\n</code></pre> <p>Reading in your target language is obviously beneficial, but it's important not to overdo it and lose motivation. If somebody is learning English I won't advise them to read Infinite Jest or Paradise Lost. I wouldn't even recommend them to read something like Harry Potter (a very common recommendation) unless they already have a decent level in the language, otherwise they'll just have to look up 30 words per page and it'll be hugely frustrating.</p> <p>Also remember that learning vocab and expressions, while absolutely crucial, is not sufficient to learn to speak a language correctly. Plenty of scholars and theologians can read Classical Greek and Latin with ease but would be hard pressed to have a conversation in them.</p>"},{"location":"reading/#article","title":"Article","text":"<ul> <li>92 Books Later: How To Learn A Language By Reading: https://linguapath.com/learn-language-through-reading/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sentence-mining/","title":"\u0110\u00e0o c\u00e2u","text":"<p>B\u00e0i vi\u1ebft thu\u1ed9c Refold</p>"},{"location":"sentence-mining/#basic-sentence-mining","title":"Basic Sentence Mining","text":"<p>Sentence mining is the process of taking words and sentences directly from your immersion and learning them with the SRS.

But, some words are going to be more worth your time than others. Because you will only be able to make a limited number of SRS cards each day, it\u2019s important to choose what to mine carefully.</p> <p>The first thing to consider is whether you truly need a card to learn something. If you think you\u2019ll remember a word without the support of the SRS, then don\u2019t make a card for it. Some words are very similar to words in your native language (NL), and you will probably only need to hear them once or twice to learn them.

And sometimes words just stick on their own, for no reason that you can point to.</p> <p>That said, initially, most words will be difficult to learn without the SRS.

There are three reasons for this.</p> <p>The first is that, oftentimes, simply knowing the meaning of a word isn\u2019t enough to fully grasp how it\u2019s used in the wild. Antimoon illustrates this idea beautifully with the definition of \u201caccount for\u201d:</p> <p>If a particular thing accounts for a part or proportion of something, that part or proportion consists of that thing, or is used or produced by it. On its own, this definition doesn\u2019t give you a real sense of what \u201caccount for\u201d really means or how it\u2019s used. However, that dictionary also provides an example sentence that makes things a lot clearer:</p> <p>Computers account for 5% of the country\u2019s commercial electricity consumption.</p> <p>In this way, a good example sentence is often crucial for really grasping a word\u2019s usage.</p> <p>The second reason for making cards based on sentences is that many words have multiple meanings. For example, the word \u201cbark\u201d means something completely different depending on whether you\u2019re talking about dogs or trees.</p> <p>Trying to memorize every meaning of a word with a single card often results in cards that are excessively difficult and cumbersome to review. It\u2019s much more effective to learn the meanings of words one at a time. This is an example of the minimum information principle, which is explained in more depth in the following section.</p> <p>Creating cards for sentences rather than individual words is the most straightforward way to narrow your focus to a single usage of the target word: simply focus on the meaning of the word in that particular sentence. Additionally, because the sentences will have come from your immersion content, you will be learning the particular meaning that\u2019s most relevant to you.</p> <p>The final reason for making cards for sentences is that they\u2019re easier to remember. Compared to an isolated word, a sentence provides a larger chunk of meaning for your brain to latch onto, and this makes it easier to internalize.</p> <p>This will be particularly true if the sentence came from an actual book or show that you watched.

You can do manual sentence mining either during intensive immersion while reading a TV show, or during free-flow immersion. Try both, you may find that both are fine, or that one suits you better than the other.</p> <p>There are two ways to go about manual sentence mining: synchronous and asynchronous.</p> <p>In synchronous mining, when you come across a sentence you want to learn while immersing, you pause your immersion and make a card for it right then and there. The benefit of this approach is that your active immersion and sentence mining become unified into a single activity. This can help to streamline your overall language learning routine.</p> <p>Some people find synchronous mining disruptive to their immersion. They prefer asynchronous mining, which separates card creation from immersion. In asynchronous mining, while immersing, you simply make note of sentences and words you want to learn. You can do this by copying and pasting the sentence into a text file or noting down the timestamp of the sentence.

The point of sentence mining is not to learn sentences, but to learn words in context.</p> <p>You consume media everyday and when you see a sentence of which you know every word but one, you save that sentence and you use it to learn that word, in the context that you found it.

Many people have become fluent without using spaced repetition.</p> <p>One alternative to using spaced repetition is randomly coming across the same word multiple times. If you're taking an immersion-based approach to language learning, eventually you will see the word enough times to\u00a0acquire it. Another alternative is keeping a notepad with a list of words you've looked up. The list has to be reviewed at times, but unlike the SRS the process is not automated.</p> <p>A major problem that happens when learning languages is that a learner is liable to forget a word over and over until the word is seen many times. The SRS takes care of that constant \"leaking bucket\" problem where you only remember things learned recently. With the SRS you are sure you don't slide down, you are only moving forward.</p> <p>Anki is popular among people learning Japanese, and apparently Chinese, but it's not that popular among learners of other languages. The reason Anki is popular is most likely that Japanese learners have to memorize how to read words written in kanji. I've been using Anki for many years, and I notice that most of the time when I fail a card it is because I don't remember the reading, not because I don't remember the meaning. People learning other languages don't have to deal with kanji, so it is easier for them to get to fluency without using the SRS.</p> <p>We recommend that people following the AJATT method use spaced repetition. For the majority of people the benefits are limitless. SRS applications help to learn vocabulary faster, overcome forgetting, close the gap between you and native speakers.

Timeboxing is especially effective at helping you to deal with activities that you're not that excited about doing.</p>"},{"location":"timeboxing/#_2","title":"H\u1ed9p th\u1eddi gian","text":""},{"location":"timeboxing/#in-language-learning","title":"In language learning","text":"<p>In language learning, timeboxing basically boils down to two things.</p> <ol> <li>Immersing in chunks.</li> <li>Doing SRS reviews in chunks.</li> </ol> <p>A good example of immersing in chunks is when we read books. Most books are long enough to make finishing them in one sitting practically impossible. But if you decide to read a book for half an hour and pause, then it becomes manageable. Many language learners struggle to read books in the beginning. Often people aren't used to reading at all, they have to learn a new skill while learning a foreign language, which places the hurdle higher. Timeboxing makes approaching reading easier.</p> <p>Doing SRS reviews in chunks is another common way to use timeboxing. The thought of doing SRS reviews rarely excites people, but it's a part of the learning process. If you partition you SRS reps into smaller chunks, finishing them should become painless. And if you have a backlog of due cards, timeboxing is most likely the only remaining tactic.</p>"},{"location":"timeboxing/#_3","title":"H\u1ed9p th\u1eddi gian","text":""},{"location":"timeboxing/#pomodoro-technique","title":"Pomodoro technique","text":"<p>Pomodoro is a type of timeboxing that involves breaking down work into focused intervals of 25 minutes, known as \"pomodoros,\" followed by short breaks of 5 minutes.
