I will not say anything about the story because it's just so good, I like to keep the story fresh because it's such experience when you read it for the first time (u/Front_Association998) Ch\u00ed Ph\u00e8o Nam Cao Medium The story is about the life of Ch\u00ed Ph\u00e8o (the main protagonist). Not the entirety but his last days. Think of Ch\u00ed Ph\u00e8o as a drunken bastard, he's cruel, inhuman as has no capacity for love and empathy. He works for this guy name c\u1ee5 B\u00e1 Ki\u1ebfn, a local landlord who seems like a kind person but is actually a piece of shit. He let Ch\u00ed Ph\u00e8o do the dirty work for him so he can keep his image. On his last days, he met Th\u1ecb N\u1edf, a woman who is infamous for her rather ugly appearance, and well they fell in love and for once in his life again, he felt love, he sees the road that has chosen and hated it. And the ending is near but I don't want to spoil it, a must read. (u/Front_Association998) S\u1ed1ng m\u00f2n Nam Cao Medium the story of a poor teacher (It has been a while so I forgot his name) who's unlike everyone else, realise that he's not living, he's just living through the day, paycheck after paycheck to survive and provide for his family. He's living like a mindless machine, just works through the day, blinded by the present so he can't see the future. He can't see his purpose, he wants to live for a bigger, meaningful goal but he can't escape the cruel machine of life. His realisation is only enough for him to know it, not escape it. Absolutely brilliant and it doubles as a life advice. (u/Front_Association998) S\u00f4ng Xa Chu Lai Medium Is there really a boundary good and bad?

With this sort of immersion, you subconsciously fill in the incomprehensible parts with educated guesses based on context, which is what makes this type of input so useful for the purposes of language learning.</p> <p>Now you may have noticed a problem here. What do you do if you don\u2019t have access to comprehensible input? As a complete beginner, there is no content that is easy. In fact, this is why people often fall into the endless cycle of reading from beginner resource to beginner resource. Though incomprehensible input is by no means useless\u2014it does have its benefits and assists with learning\u2014it is very difficult to get past that initial hurdle.</p> <p>Failing to understand the content you want to enjoy inherently sucks unless you take a specific mindset to it\u2014taking pleasure in the knowledge that you are making gradual progress, even if that progress is immediately imperceptible.

Fun! Media can be entertaining for reasons other than language content. By choosing media that also has high entertainment value regardless of its language level, we are able to stay consistently engaged and motivated to continue our immersion. Then, as our language experience grows, we naturally find ourselves understanding more and more, and the once seemingly unattainable goal of finding comprehensible input has now become a given, with the goal rather shifting to finding content that is difficult enough to push us to continue learning.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#17-how-to-immerse","title":"1.7 How to immerse","text":""},{"location":"guide/#reading-dictionaries","title":"Reading &amp; Dictionaries","text":"<p>To make Vietnamese less of a pain to read, you can use a free browser extension known as Yomitan.

While output won't directly improve your proficiency at the language, it is still quite important to be practicing output, whether it is by texting or with speech, because input and output go hand in hand. Doing output effectively forces your brain to make sure it is correctly understanding the words you are hearing and you may start to subconsciously look for opportunities to use what you hear in input. Regular output along with regular input is recommended.</p> <p>Contrary to what many immersion-based learning methods say, I do not believe it is a smart idea to delay your output until you are \"really good\" for reasons such as \"saying things incorrectly is going to \"cripple\" or \"ruin\" your Vietnamese\".
