I think that if you're not in a situation where you can take classes from someone who uses CI techniques, then you kind of have to use more traditional study methods (mixed with as much comprehensible input as possible) until you're at a level where you can understand native content at a decent level.</p> <p>Reading a lot of stuff way above your level is not what proponents of CI suggest you do because it can be very slow and discouraging - but some people are carried through by sheer passion and ambition, like I was. It definitely helped me relative to the other people in my class who weren't doing as much out-of-class reading as I was.</p> <p>In my opinion, comprehensible input is great but it's not the cure to learning a language. It's part of the prescription, joined with many other things. I'm not sure how comprehensible input could work for someone trying to self-study unless you're following a plan made by someone else. Otherwise it'll be really hard to find material that is comprehensible to you. Most media made for native speaker isn't truly comprehensible to learners until they've entered intermediate or advanced level.</p>"},{"location":"input/#immersion","title":"Immersion","text":"<p>If you're already at a high-intermediate level, then watching TV/movies without subtitles can be comprehensible input, but if you're a beginner, it's not. For comprehensible input, you're looking for content you can understand 95%-98% of. (You will get SOME comprehensible input if you understand less than that, but if you can understand very little of what you hear, it's not comprehensible input anymore). Not using subtitles has nothing to do with comprehensible input. Comprehensible input proponents generally encourage people to use subtitles (but more importantly, you should find content that's so easy you don't need subtitles).</p> <p>Of course, immersion is something you do in your free time, so you can do it even in the beginning, after you're done with your daily hour of studying. And to avoid forgetting what you've learned, use a memory aid program like Anki. Stick sentences in Japanese on the front card, what they mean on the back card.</p>"},{"location":"input/#a-list-of-vietnamese-comprehensible-input","title":"A List Of Vietnamese Comprehensible Input.","text":""},{"location":"input/#listening","title":"Listening","text":"<p>(These 3 playlists are made by VietnameseClass101)</p> <ul> <li>Absolute Beginner</li> <li>Beginner</li> <li>Intermediate</li> </ul> <p>Other</p> <ul> <li>holy phun: there is only 2 </li> <li>Vlog in Slow Vietnamese</li> <li>Slow Vietnamese Input</li> <li>Easy Vietnamese - Learn Vietnamese from the streets!</li> <li>Authentic Vietnamese with subtitles: A Playlist made by Learn Vietnamese with Annie.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"input/#reading","title":"Reading","text":"<ul> <li>Vietnamese Reading Resources written by a random Vietnamese Italki teacher</li> <li>B\u00e0i vi\u1ebft h\u1ecdc sinh.
