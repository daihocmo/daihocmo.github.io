The important concepts with the best educational resources i've ever found on memory techniques:

**(1) Spaced repetition -** this technique lets you remember things by systematically reminding you of the information over time in a spread-out way optimised for your long-term memory. Only 5 mins a day spent on this technique can have a massive impact on your memory. Its effectiveness grows exponentially over time the more you use it aswell so it quickly starts to have a massive impact on your life.

**(2) Memory palaces / Method of Loci -** our memory is much better at remembering images & locations than things like concepts and text. Memory palaces take advantage of this by turning what you want to learn into an image & location. You practice imagining a house you know well and then in your mind place new pieces of information in different parts of the house. It takes a lot of effort to build your memory palace to begin with but once you have it it will help you remember things efficiently for your whole life.

**(4) Why memory is important** - your memory is surprisingly important for your learning speed. If you remember more you can understand and contexualise more things and therefore learn ***much*** faster. It has a domino effect on your ability to learn. These two articles explain in more depth why memory is so important.
